Homogeneous diffusion is a simple linear diffusion process. It's described by the equation:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \Delta u$$

where $u$ is the image intensity and $t$ is time. This process smooths the image uniformly in all directions, which can be useful for noise reduction but may also blur important features.
